#───┘ a boring but important thing └────────────────────────────

#
# First of all, let me tell you a story that may possibly be
# boring to you and possibly important to you.
#
# Misskey is licensed under the AGPLv3 license. This license is
# known to be often misunderstood.  Please read the following
# instructions carefully and select the appropriate option so
# that you do not negligently cause a license violation.
#

# --------
# Option 1: If you host Misskey AS-IS (without any changes to
#           the source code. forks are not included).
#
# Step 1: Congratulations! You don't need to do anything.

# --------
# Option 2: If you have made changes to the source code (forks
#           are included) and publish a Git repository of source
#           code.  There should be no access restrictions on
#           this repository.  Strictly speaking, it doesn't have
#           to be a Git repository, but you'll probably use Git!
#
# Step 1: Build and run the Misskey server first.
# Step 2: Open <https://your.misskey.example/admin/settings> in
#         your browser with the administrator account.
# Step 3: Enter the URL of your Git repository in the
#         "Repository URL" field.

# --------
# Option 3: If neither of the above applies to you.
#           (In this case, the source code should be published
#           on the Misskey interface.  IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO
#           DISCLOSE THE SOURCE CODE WHEN A USER REQUESTS IT BY
#           E-MAIL OR OTHER MEANS.  If you are not satisfied
#           with this, it is recommended that you read the
#           license again carefully.  Anyway, enabling this
#           option will automatically generate and publish a
#           tarball at build time, protecting you from
#           inadvertent license violations. (There is no legal
#           guarantee, of course.)  The tarball will generated
#           from the root directory of your codebase.  So it is
#           also recommended to check <built/tarball> directory
#           once after building and before activating the server
#           to avoid ACCIDENTAL LEAKING OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION.
#           To prevent certain files from being included in the
#           tarball, add a glob pattern after line 15 in
#           <scripts/tarball.mjs>.  DO NOT FORGET TO BUILD AFTER
#           ENABLING THIS OPTION!)
#
# Step 1: Uncomment the following line.
