# Frequently Asked Questions
This document will list answers to frequently asked questions regarding the usage of Misskey. Answers to frequently asked questions related to Misskey as a project can be found [here](./misskey).

## "Are there any apps for iOS / Android available?"
While no official Misskey app for either OS exists, there are several third-party applications. For details, please check [here](./apps).

However, functionality of third-party applications will inevitably lag behind the official Web client, so unless you really want to use a native application, we recommend the official Web client instead. As the Misskey Web client supports PWA, it is possible to make it act as if it was a native application instead. For details regarding this, please check [here](todo).

## "Can't I log in through a Mastodon client?"
MisskeyはMastodonのAPIと互換性がないため、一部を除きMastodonクライアントでMisskeyを利用することはできません。
