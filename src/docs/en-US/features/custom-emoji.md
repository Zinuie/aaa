# Custom Emoji
Custom emoji is a function that allows you to use the image prepared by the instance like an emoji. It can be used in places such as notes, reactions, chats, self-introductions, names, etc. To use your custom emoji in those places, press the emoji picker button (if any) or type `:` to see the emoji suggestion. If a string of the form `:foo:` is found in the text, the `foo` part will be interpreted as the custom emoji name and will be replaced with the corresponding custom emoji when displayed.
