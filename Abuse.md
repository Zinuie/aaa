## Notfreespee.ch Accounts, Abuse and Bots policy

## Accounts policy:
All accounts made on the site may be terminated for the following reasons:

* Inactivity: Accounts that are judged inactive for a determined period of time will be deleted as part of a cleanup against potential botnets and inactive users. The periods of time of inactivity to enact such a solution are as such:

- 7 days after the creation of the account if no posts are made.
- A month after the creation of the account very few posts are made (under 10 posts).
- 6 months after the last known post made by the account unless the account has made more than a thousand posts.
- A full year after the last post of a "prolific poster" account, that is more than 1000 posts. In which case the account will simply be archived and deactivated, rather than deleted.

* Targeted abuse:

Accounts which participate in so called "internet crusades" against particular individuals, unless said individual is "prolific" (that is verified or otherwise "important", as for an administrator or other), will find themselves rid of their accounts. Targeted spam is unallowed.

* Doxing:

Doxing will find your account terminated and contact to law enforcement if relevant. It acceptable under no circumstances, no matter the excuse.

* Illegal imagery:

Certain types of pornography are allowed and others disallowed. What is specifically disallowed and allowed is as such:

Allowed:
- Drawn depiction of any types of porn (legal within the U.S.A.).
- Legal "real pornography" as pertaining to Californian law.

Disallowed: 
- Real bestiality porn.
- Real child porn.
- Anything resembling real child porn (3D, rotoscoped or otherwise)
Posting any of the above will find your account terminated and contact to relevant law enforcement made.

## Bots policy
Bots are allowed within the site if they bring a "useful feature", which will be decided when the time is relevant. 

What is specifically allowed (policy will be updated with time) is as such:
- RSS bots
- Communication bots (so called TayBots)
- Mailbots
- Mirror bots (say for Twitter accounts)
- Archive bots

What is not allowed is as such:
- Dormant bots
- Follow bots
- Spam bots (commercial or not)

Any such account will be removed and repeated offending IP addresses will be banned incrementally from a day, to a week, to a month, to a full year. Bots which provide no usage to the userbase are a waste of data and my precious money. They are disallowed for that reason.
